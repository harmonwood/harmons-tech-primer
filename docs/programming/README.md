# Programming Theory

Programming theory is the study of the fundamental concepts of computer programming. Programming theory to me is about being a better programmer and communicator. If want to learn how to program stop overthinking it and just start a project. If you are a more experienced programmer and want to better understand what differentiates a great programmer from a good one, then this is the place for you.

???+ TLDR;
Programming theory is about being a better communicator. The key is simple. Write readable code. Write code *to* the next developer that will read it.

## What programs do

Programs are a set of instructions that tell inform a computer what to do. Realistically there are only three general things that a program can do.

### 1. Input and Output (I/O):

This is the most basic and useful of things. Taking input and converting it to a consumable output. Like a a VoiP call input to a speaker output. The modern email, text message, phone call, social media app. Are the most basic programs with the largest impact.

### 2. Data Manipulation:

This is generally the math or transformers. Programs that do a little more the just I/O they change the data. Math is the most common form of data manipulation. A calculator app is a common example of this.

### 3. Control Flow

This is the ability to make decisions and change the flow of the data. Examples of this are if statements, loops. The ability to put logic in the math really unlocks the power of computers. Being able to a something in a specific order. Or changing the order based on a condition.

It is important to understand that everything a program will ever do is one of these three things and as modern programers we are just combining these three things in different ways to create more complex programs. The issue here is "complex programs." The more complex the harder it is to understand and the harder it is to change. This is why we need to focus on writing readable code. To make sure intent is communicated to the next developer. When they run into a bug or business requirement change. The question to answer is simple. Can they read the intent of the code and make the change without breaking anything else?

I know I said that programs only do three things but there is a fourth thing that programers do.

### 4. Abstraction

Abstraction is the most fundamental thing there is to writing maintainable code. Sure you can write a program in binary, or assembly and there are still cases to do so today. Mostly the tool of choice is a higher order language such as Java, C#, Ruby, Python, JavaScript, etc. These languages are all abstractions of the lower level languages. They are easier to read and write. They are still only tools. I can write a program in any of these languages that looks and reads like assembly. We must still choose to write readable code with these tools.

Most companies we work for want fast, stable code that accomplishes a business need, now. Then one day a few years later something goes wrong or a new pivot in business happens. The architect realizes that only the Subject Matter Expert has a chance of being successfully at this project. This bottleneck could easily been avoided with readable code.
